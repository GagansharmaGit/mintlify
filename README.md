# Mintlify Clone Project

This project is a recreation of the Mintlify website's frontend, designed to replicate its modern dark-themed aesthetic and responsive layout.

> **Note:** This website was designed and optimized on a 15-inch laptop.

## Recreated Sections

The following sections from the original Mintlify website have been meticulously recreated in `index.html` and `style.css`:

1.  **Header/Navbar**: Fixed navigation bar with blur effect, logo, navigation links (Resources, Documentation, etc.), and "Contact Sales"/"Start for free" buttons.
2.  **Hero Section**: Main landing area with the "Intelligent Knowledge Platform" headline, email input form, and hero graphics.
3.  **Logos Section**: A grid display of partner logos (Anthropic, Coinbase, etc.).
4.  **Intelligence Section**: "Built for the intelligence age" section featuring feature cards for LLMs.txt, MCP, and AI Assistant.
5.  **Enterprise Section**: Comprehensive section highlighting "Enterprise-reinvention", partnership, compliance/SSO features, and a detailed customer story card (Anthropic).
6.  **Knowledge Section**: "Unlock knowledge for any industry" section containing a horizontal carousel of customer success stories (Perplexity, Kalshi, etc.).
7.  **Documentation Section**: Call-to-action area ("Make documentation your winning advantage") with cards for Pricing and Quickstart.
8.  **Footer**: Extensive footer with multiple columns (Explore, Resources, Documentation, Company, Legal), security badges, and system status indicator.

## Design System

### Fonts
The project primarily uses the **Inter** font family for a clean, modern look, with specific fallbacks and accents:
- **Primary**: `Inter` (used for body text, headings, and UI elements).
- **Accent/Technical**: `Geist Mono` (used for small all-caps headers like "CUSTOMER STORY").
- **Display**: `Impact` (used for specific large section titles in the Knowledge section).

### Colors
The design implements a sophisticated dark mode palette:
- **Backgrounds**: Deep blacks and dark greys (`black`, `#0a0b0c`, `#151616`).
- **Primary Actions**: Bright Blue (`#2563EB`) for main buttons.
- **Accents**:
    - **Teal/Cyan**: `lab(79.98% -59.63 22.51)` (used for subheadings and card titles).
    - **Green**: `#0C8C5E` (used for "New" pills).
- **Text**: High-contrast White (`#FFFFFF` or `lab(100 0 0)`) for primary text, with ~70% opacity for secondary text to create hierarchy.
- **Effects**: Extensive use of `backdrop-filter: blur()` and semi-transparent backgrounds (`rgba(8, 15, 30, 0.35)`) for glassmorphism effects.
